# nvim-config-validation
This repository contains sample C#, Python, Go, TypeScript and bash projects.  I am new to nvim and am making a lot of changes, many of which break things i do not want broken!  I use this repo as a quick test, opening up the various projects in the languages i work with most often, in order to confirm everything is still working as i need.
